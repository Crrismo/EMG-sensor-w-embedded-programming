# EMG-sensor-w-embeddedm-programming
Outline of the EMG Sensor system: 

    Amplify a signal, from a muscle, of few millivolts and display an output corresponding to the input 

    As outputs we chose the Bar LED, Servo, LED and wireless display 

    The LED works with PWM, the wireless display works over serial with a wireless module, the BAR LED works with digital pins and thresholds set within program. The servo motor is controlled by (sending an electrical impulse of variable width) PWM
